Minor Proect for B-Tech CSE student


*INTRODUCTION*

2048 is a popular puzzle game that challenges players to merge numbered tiles to create a tile 
with the number 2048. The game can be played on any device with a web browser, and is built 
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The objective of the game is to merge tiles with the same value by sliding them in one of four 
directions - up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same value are merged, their values 
are added together, creating a new tile with a higher value. The game is won when a tile with 
the value of 2048 is created, although players can continue to play beyond this point.
The game is implemented using JavaScript, which handles the game logic and user input. The 
game board is created using HTML and styled with CSS, while JavaScript handles the game 
logic, such as detecting user input, updating the state of the game board, and rendering the 
board to the screen.
By using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game provides an engaging and interactive 
experience for players of all skill levels. The game is both challenging and addictive, requiring 
strategic thinking and quick reflexes. Whether played on a desktop or mobile device, the 2048 
game provides a fun and satisfying puzzle experience.


*OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE*

The objective of the 2048 JavaScript game is to merge numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to reach 
the highest possible tile value of 2048. Players must slide the tiles in one of four directions -
up, down, left, or right - to merge tiles of the same value, creating a new tile with a higher 
value.
The scope of the game extends beyond simply reaching the 2048 tile. Players can continue to 
play and strive to achieve higher scores by merging tiles and creating tiles with even higher 
values. The game can be played on any device with a web browser, making it accessible to a 
wide audience.
The game also provides opportunities for customization and variation. For example, developers 
can modify the game board size, tile values, and scoring system to create new challenges and 
game modes. Additionally, the game's visual design can be customized to fit different themes 
or aesthetics.
Overall, the objective and scope of the 2048 JavaScript game provide a fun and engaging puzzle 
experience that can be enjoyed by players of all skill levels. The game's flexibility and 
adaptability also allow for endless possibilities for variation and customization

*METHODOLOGY / TECHNOLOGY USED*

The 2048 JavaScript game is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
technologies. The methodology or technology used in building the game can be broken down 
into the following components:
1. HTML: The game board and other user interface elements are created using HTML 
markup. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid of square tiles, each with a numbered value.
2. CSS: The game board and user interface elements are styled using CSS. CSS is used to add 
color, font, and other visual elements to the game.
3. JavaScript: The game logic and user input handling are implemented using JavaScript. 
JavaScript is used to detect user input, update the state of the game board, and render the 
board to the screen. JavaScript is also used to track the player's score and determine when the 
game is won or lost.
4. Libraries and frameworks: Developers may choose to use third-party libraries or 
frameworks to aid in the development of the game. For example, jQuery can be used to 
simplify user input handling, while React or Vue.js can be used to build more complex user 
interfaces.
Overall, the methodology and technology used in building the 2048 JavaScript game are 
focused on creating a responsive and engaging user experience, with intuitive controls and 
smooth animation. The use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows the game to be played on 
any device with a web browser, making it accessible to a wide audience
